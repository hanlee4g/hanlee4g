- Hello! My name is Han and I am a Sophomore at Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
- Nowadays I am very interested in how people interact with and learn from educational technology.
- I’m currently reading Man's Search for Meaning and Why Nations Fail
- I'm currently working on a project that aims to provide much improved metrics (visualization, comparisons, predictions, goal-setting) for early childhood education.
- I'm looking to collaborate on anything exciting that has high impact potential.
- You can reach me at hanlee4g@gmail.com or hanjune@u.northwestern.edu
