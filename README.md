My name is Han and I am a 3rd-year Computer Science undergrad at Northwestern University. I'm originally from the Bay Area.

- Professionally, I have experience as...
  * a software / electrical engineering intern at [Soundskrit](https://soundskrit.ca/) where I worked on directional MEMS microphones.
  * a STEP (software engineering) intern at [Google](https://www.google.com/) where I worked on privacy governance engineering. I am returning in Summer 2023 as a Software Engineering Intern on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
  * an Operations Associate at [Techstars Chicago](https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/chicago), a startup accelerator.

- Project-wise...
  * I lead a team of 10 people (8 engineers) in building [Inbound](https://joininbound.com/), an early career talent sourcing platform built around diversity-based and talent-based student groups.
  * I simulated evolution to make robots that run really fast through [this project](https://github.com/hanlee4g/mybots).
  * I was one of 3 authors for a [guide on security and privacy for tech startups](https://github.com/hanlee4g/startup-security-privacy).

- Academically...
  * I am interested in scalable software development and machine learning.
  * I am also very interested in philosophy.
